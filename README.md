Coding Week 2025 - ML Tasks
This repository contains the solution of Task 1 – CampusPulse  along with project reports in PDF explaining my approach, experimentations and results.

Task 1 – CampusPulse
The notebook is organized as follows:

* INITIAL TABLES AND PROCESSING
* LEVEL 1 
* LEVEL 2
* LEVEL 3 -QUESTION 1-QUESTION 5
* LEVEL 4
* LEVEL 5
* BONUS TASK




Approach Summary
Data Understanding: To understand patterns in data and identify anonymous features.
Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, handling nulls, normalization and identify missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): For Exploratory Insight Report and getting more interpretation from the data.
Model Building: Several models were trained including Logistic Regression, Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning (using gridsearchCV and randomsearchCV), Gausian Naive Bayes, KNN.
Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix were used to evaluate model performance and then I chose the best out of them.
Model Reasoning & Interpretation: Created decision boundaries and accessed the features using SHAP.
Bonus Section: Using the created decision boundaries and also reading furthur sources, identified the 5 decision plots for different models.
